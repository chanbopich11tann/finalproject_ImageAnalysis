# API Name: Image Analysis

## Purpose

This API facilitates various image processing tasks like handwriting extraction, landmark detection, and image description using Azure Cognitive Services. It provides functionalities to interact with Azure's Computer Vision API.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To get started, ensure you have Python installed. Then, clone the repository and install the required dependencies using the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chanbopich11tann/finalproject_ImageAnalysis.git
cd final_project_api
```

### Authentication

1. I obtained an API key and endpoint from Azure Cognitive Services.
2. I created a `credential.json` file in the root directory with the following structure:

```json
{
    "API_KEY": "d5dab499fc804fb28355568d460055f8",
    "ENDPOINT": "https://ai-vision-api-demo.cognitiveservices.azure.com/"
} 
```

## Usage

### Handwriting Extraction

#### Code Example:

```python
# Code for handwriting extraction
# ...
```

### Landmark Detection

#### Code Example:

```python
# Code for landmark detection
# ...
```

### Image Description

#### Code Example:

```python
# Code for image description
# ...
```

## Error Handling

The API handles errors gracefully. Check the response status and handle exceptions as needed. Refer to the API documentation for error codes and messages.

## Best Practices

- Use descriptive variable names in your code.
- Ensure proper error handling to manage unexpected scenarios.
- Optimize API calls by batching requests where possible.
